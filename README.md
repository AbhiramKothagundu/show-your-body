# Show Your Body

## Overview
**Show Your Body** is a mobile application that utilizes **MoveNet** (or another pose tracking model) to track human body movements and provide real-time analysis. This project leverages **TensorFlow Lite** for efficient on-device pose estimation and is implemented using **Android (Java/Kotlin)**.

## Features
- **Real-time pose tracking** using MoveNet
- **User-friendly interface** to visualize body movements
- **Customizable backend URL** for data processing
- **Seamless integration** with Android UI components

## Technologies Used
- **MoveNet / PoseNet** for pose estimation
- **TensorFlow Lite (TFLite)** for on-device inference
- **Android (Java/Kotlin)** for mobile application development
- **Jetpack Compose / XML-based UI** for user interface
- **WebSocket / REST API** (Optional) for backend communication

## Installation
### Prerequisites:
- Android Studio (latest version)
- Android device with Camera permission enabled
- Internet connection (for backend services, if applicable)

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/show-your-body.git
   ```
2. Open the project in **Android Studio**
3. Build and run the application on an **Android Emulator** or a **Physical Device**

## Usage
1. **Launch the app** on your Android device.
2. **Grant camera permissions** when prompted.
3. **Point the camera at a human body**, and the app will track body movements in real-time.
4. **Modify backend URL** in settings to send data to a custom server (if applicable).

## How It Works
- The **camera captures** a live feed of the userâ€™s body.
- **MoveNet (or PoseNet)** detects and tracks key points of the body (e.g., head, shoulders, elbows, knees).
- The app **visualizes** the detected poses using overlays.
- Optionally, data can be **sent to a backend** for further analysis or visualization.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve model accuracy with **custom-trained models**
- Implement **gesture recognition** for interactive applications
- Support **multiple users tracking** simultaneously
- Add **integration with fitness applications**
